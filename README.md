# GanymedeSpectralEstimation
Loads the .oct files from a Thorlabs Ganymede system and performs the RFIAA algorithm to obtain superresolution. The algorithm is taken from this paper: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.439761 .

 Not all .oct save files are supported yet: only the first Bscan is processed. This means that no averaging is applied.
