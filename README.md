# GanymedeSpectralEstimation
Loads the .oct files from a Thorlabs Ganymede system and performs the RFIAA algorithm to obtain superresolution. (At the moment, some of the individual functions work and tested against existing Matlab code, but at the moment, the output is still a conventional Fourier transform.)
